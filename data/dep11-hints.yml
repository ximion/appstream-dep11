svgz-decompress-error:
  text: "Unable to decompress SVGZ icon '%(icon_fname)s'. Error: %(error)s"
  severity: error

icon-format-unsupported:
  text: "Icon file '%(icon_fname)s' uses an unsupported image file format."
  severity: error

icon-not-found:
  text: >
        The icon '%(icon_fname)s' was not found in the archive. This issue can have multiple reasons:
        <ul>
         <li>The icon is not present in the archive.</li>
         <li>The icon is in a wrong directory.</li>
         <li>The icon is not available in a suitable size (at least 64x64px)</li>
        </ul>
        To make the icon easier to find, place it in <code>/usr/share/icons/hicolor/&lt;size&gt;/apps</code> and ensure the <code>Icon=</code> value
        of the .desktop file is set correctly.
  severity: error

icon-open-failed:
  text: >
        Unable to open icon file '%(icon_fname)s'. Error: %(error)s<br/>
        This means the generator could not render the icon to its appropriate size, and the icon has therefore been ignored.
  severity: error

deb-filelist-error:

metainfo-no-id:
  text: Could not determine an id for this component. The AppStream upstream metadata likely lacks an <code>&lt;id/&gt;</code> tag.<br/>
        The identifier tag is absolutely essential for AppStream metadata, and must never be missing.
  severity: error

missing-desktop-file:
  text: Found an AppStream upstream XML file, but the associated .desktop file is missing. This often happens when the .desktop file is renamed, but the
        <code>&lt;id/&gt;</code> tag of the AppStream metainfo file is not adepted as well, or if the metainfo file is located in a different package than the .desktop file.<br/>
        Please fix the packaging or work with upstream to resolve this issue.

  severity: warning

screenshot-read-error:
  text: >
        Error while reading screenshot data for '%(screenshot_name)s' of component '%(cpt_id)s': %(error)s<br/>
        Maybe the server returned an invalid image (e.g. an error page), or the image data is broken.
  severity: warning

metainfo-no-type:
  text: Component has no type defined. A component type (desktop, input-method, generic, ...) is essential. This issue is likely a mistyped component
        typename in the metainfo file, or an internal bug in the data extractor (componenty without <code>Type=</code> count as generic components automatically,
        so unless there is a typo somewhere, no component should ever have no type).
  severity: error

metainfo-no-name:
  text: Component has no name specified. Ensure that the AppStream upstream metadata or the .desktop file (if there is any) specify a component name.
  severity: error

metainfo-no-package:
  text: Component has no package defined. A package must be associated with a component. This is likely a bug in the generator.

metainfo-no-summary:
  text: >
        Component does not contain a short summary. Ensure that the component's metainfo file has a <code>summary</code> tag, or that its .desktop file
        has a <code>Comment=</code> field set. Especially applications by KDE often use the <code>GenericName</code> field for a short summary,
        instead of the <code>Comment</code> field (which is not its intended use case).<br/>
